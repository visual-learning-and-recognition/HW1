    "\n",

    "As you might have seen, the performance of the SimpleCNN model was pretty low for PASCAL. This is expected as PASCAL is much more complex than FASHION MNIST, and we need a much beefier model to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will be constructing a variant of the [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) architecture, known as CaffeNet. If you are familiar with Caffe, a prototxt of the network is available [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/train_val.prototxt). A visualization of the network is available [here](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/preset/caffenet).\n",
